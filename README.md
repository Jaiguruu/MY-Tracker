## The Philosophy: Embrace the Delusion

We've all had that middle-of-the-night idea. The one that feels both brilliant and utterly insane. "I'll have coffee with Elon Musk." "I'll build a unicorn startup from my garage." "I'll master quantum physics by Christmas."

Most of the time, we dismiss them as daydreams. This project asks, "But what if you didn't?"

**Project: Moonshot** is a specialized progress tracker born from that exact feeling. It‚Äôs a tool designed to take your most unrealistic ambitions and ground them in a tangible, step-by-step process. It doesn't judge the size of your dream; it just gives you a framework to start chipping away at it.

## Features: Your Toolkit for the Impossible

This isn't just a checklist. It's an operating system for your ambition, currently in active development.

  * **üó∫Ô∏è Multi-Step Roadmaps:** Deconstruct your "moonshot" goal into a series of achievable milestones and steps. See the entire journey from start to finish.
  * **‚úçÔ∏è Daily Progress Logging:** Document your wins, setbacks, and learnings every day. Create a rich history of your journey to stay motivated.
  * **üìä Skill Acquisition Stats:** As you complete tasks, log the new skills you acquire. Watch your personal skill tree grow over time.
  * **‚è±Ô∏è Integrated 'Deep Focus' Timer:** A built-in Pomodoro timer to help you enter intense, focused work sessions on the tasks that matter most.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, performant, and scalable technology stack:

  * **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
  * **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / SCSS (or your choice)
  * **AI/Backend Integration:** Google Gemini API [work in progress]
